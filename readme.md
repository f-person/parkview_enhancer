# South Park Enhancer
A browser extension that adds useful features for enjoying South Park on the official website

## Features
* Adds a "Skip Intro" button
* Automatically hides the cursor after a few seconds of inactivity on the video player
* Always play/pause the video when the spacebar is pressed (instead of scrolling
  the page if the video is not focused)
* Configurable seeking time (defaults to 5 seconds)

#### Planned Features
* Keep track of watched episodes
* Manually mark an episode as watched or unwatched
* "True Random" (currently, the "Random" button randomly selects an episode from 
  a pre-defined list of episodes that gets occasionally updated)
* If possible, force the HLS player to use the highest quality video stream
* Make the "FULL EPISODES" text on the homepage clickable
* Add a better season selection view to the left side of "full episodes"/season pages
* A dark mode? (maybe)

The extension isn't yet available on any stores but it's under review and will be
available soon. In the meantime, you can install it manually.
